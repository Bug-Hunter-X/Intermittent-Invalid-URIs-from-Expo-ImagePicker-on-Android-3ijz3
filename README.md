# Expo ImagePicker Invalid URI Bug on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's ImagePicker library on Android where, intermittently, the returned image URI is invalid.  The URI may be missing, incorrect, or point to a non-existent file.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android device or emulator.
3. Select an image from the gallery.
4. Observe that the image sometimes fails to load, indicating an invalid URI.

## Solution

A proposed solution involves adding error handling and potentially using a different method to access the image data if the initial URI is invalid.  The solution is implemented in `bugSolution.js`.
